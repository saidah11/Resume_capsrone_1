        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>I am a graphic designer located in beautiful Bedford, NH who combines my education, personal and professional experience, 
            technical expertise, and in-depth knowledge of the design process in everything I help create. Design is more than 
            simply making things look pretty and starts with taking into account the art, science, purpose, and user experience of 
            the design itself. I am well-versed in the creation process of media for print and digital output, along with templating 
            and producing print and digital media. I am a self-starter who can manage multiple projects from concept to completion, 
            to produce results that meet or exceed expectations. </p>
